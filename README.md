# School_District_Analysis
Using Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook and Python to report/analyze public school test scores.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was is to analyze 15 schools and their to asses previous year performanc metrics and support a School Board's funding allocation decisions. Throughout the analysis new information arose questioning the legitmacy of Thomas High School's 9th grade reading & math scores. To better understand the data, I calculated specific metrics  to better assist the School Board's decision making process.

Using the data provided, I have identified and calculated the following metrics:
- Average student Math/Reading Score by **District**
- Average student Math/Reading Score by **District**
- Percentage of students passing both Math & Reading by **District** (See "% Overall Passing")
- Average student Math/Reading Score by **School**
- Percentage of students passing Math/Reading by **School**
- Percentage of students passing both Math & Reading by **School** (See "% Overall Passing")

For each metric listed above I have recalculated the metrics to nullify all math and reading scores for the 9th grade class of Thomas High School. Then I compared this recalculation to the original metrics to better understand the impact of the new information and provide more value to the School Board for their decision making process.

## Results

1. School District Results & Impact

  The School District showed a broad drop in all metrics once the new information was taken into account. (see data below)
  
  
  
  Both the Average Math and % of Passing Math score dropped. Leaving a negative impact on the % of Overall Passing for the school district.
